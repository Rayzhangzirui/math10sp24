    "Given the *training dataset* $x_i\\in\\mathbb{R}$, $y_i\\in\\mathbb{R}$, $i= 1,2,..., N$, we want to find the linear function $$y\\approx f(x)=wx +b$$ that fits the relations between $x_i$ and $y_i$. So that given any new $x^{test}$ in the **test** dataset, we can make the prediction $$y^{pred} = w x^{test}+b$$\n",
