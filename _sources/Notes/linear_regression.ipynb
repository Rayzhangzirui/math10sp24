    "Given the *training dataset* $(x_i\\in\\mathbb{R},y_i}\\in\\mathbb{R}), i= 1,2,..., N$, we want to find the linear function $$y\\approx f(x)=wx +b$$ that fits the relations between $x_i$ and $y_i}$. So that given any new $x^{test}$ in the **test** dataset, we can make the prediction $$y^{pred} = w x^{test}+b$$\n",

    "- With the training dataset, define the loss function $L(w,b)$ of parameter $w$ and $b$, which is also called **mean squared error** (MSE) $$L(w,b)=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N\\big(\\hat{y}^{(i)}-y_i}\\big)^2=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N\\big((wx_i+b)-y_i}\\big)^2,$$ where $\\hat{y}^{(i)}$ denotes the predicted value of y at $x_i$, i.e. $\\hat{y}^{(i)} = wx_i+b$.\n",
