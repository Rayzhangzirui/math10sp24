**Late enrollment**: If you are on the waitlist for the class, you're responsible for completing the same assignments as the rest of the class if you hope to eventually enroll in the class.

**About collaboration**: You are welcome to work on homework problems together, but you should write up your own submission. 

**About ChatGPT**: ChatGPT (or other AI Language Model) is a valuable resource for programming help. Please use it wisely: (1) Relying too heavily on ChatGPT might hinder your learning. The exams are closed computers. (2) Code from ChatGPT might be incorrect. Remember to thoroughly review and understand the generated code.  

**Academic integrity**: Following the UCI academic integrity policy is a requirement to pass this class. Please see this website for more information on that policy: https://aisc.uci.edu/.

**Gradescope**: we will use Gradescope for grading the in-class quizzes, homework, and exams. It can be accessed from Canvas.

**Ed Discussion**: this is an online space where students can post questions about the course material and homework and anyone in the class can answer.
